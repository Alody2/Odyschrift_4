# Odyschrift_4
human computer interaction based on four basic signals 

Odyschrift is a method to interact with a computer by using only four input channels. 

We use Arduino computers to develop the technic. 

The central file is Odyschrift.ino.  

Momentary we are developing 'Vier op een rij'.

On the moment we refresh this sketch. We are developing the library 'OdyInput' so we can use 'Vier op een rij' easily with another Arduino than the Arduino we use now. And also to reuse the code in our next applicatione. This will be OdyLezen. 

* OdyVierOprij. 

will be the first one. Vier op een rij is a game. There is a board which had eight columns and five rows. There are two players. Each  tries to put four fiches on a row in the board.

The next module we will develope is OdyLezen. The user writes messages with Odyschrift on a display. 

 
* Odylezen.
